## About Me

Hello, and welcome! My name is Neil, and I have a PhD in high energy physics. My thesis was a precision mass measurement of the Higgs boson performed in collaboration with the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment at the European Center for Nuclear Research's (CERN) Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Which is all together too many acronyms, and a mouthful and a half. This 7 year effort allowed me to focus on software engineering and optimization, and it culminated in the most precise measurement of the mass of the Higgs boson to date. From there I bounced around a little. I left academia for industry, as so many physicists seem to do, and worked as a machine learning engineer at Sentera where I worked on computer vision in agricultural robotics. Turns out you *can* teach a computer to distinguish between sub-species variants of corn. From there I went to work at Huntington bank as a Sr. Data Scientist where I mostly focused on modernizing computational pipelines for designing, evaluating, and monitoring marketing strategy test designs. And now I'm working at Eagle Rock Analytics on some fun and interesting problems in climate data access.

When I'm not coding, you'll find me 🧗 bouldering, 🥏 playing disc golf, 👨‍🍳 cooking, or 🚐🛫 traveling!
